The model I used for my 2024 March Madness bracket submissions (men/women) is located in this repository.

It uses a previously successful submission that can be found here: https://github.com/fakyras/ncaa_women_2018/blob/master/win_ncaa.R
I also implement a custom ELO rating system which is then fed into the Raddar model. It performed well during the 2024 tournament - I finished in the top 5.9% of submissions per ESPN.
